So we are back from Fiji. Fiji is a very special place one both [Erica][3f5b306b] and I will never forget. I will be posting pictures and videos within the next few days from the trip. Here's one video as a sampler - [Video][d6cbeefb]. I will also be trying to list out what we did daily in chronological order.

* **Travel In -** We had a driver take us from our house to the LAX airport, this is key to making sure you don't have a ton of stress trying to find parking or being charged a bunch while using the airport parking.
* **Day 1 -**
* **Day 2 -**
* **Day 3 -**
* **Day 4 -**
* **Day 5 -**
* **Travel Out -**
