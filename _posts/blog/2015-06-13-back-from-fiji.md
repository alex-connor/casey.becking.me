So we are back from Fiji. Fiji is a very special place one both [Erica][3f5b306b] and I will never forget. I will be posting pictures and videos within the next few days from the trip. Here's one video as a sampler - [Video][d6cbeefb]. The resort we stayed at was called [The Remote Resort][9b1729b5]. This was by far the best decision we have ever made. The staff and family of the resort are the best people we have met in a very long time. The owners of the resort Natasha & Dan both made us feel very much at home from the second we got on the boat (which Dan was captinaing) till the second we stepped back off the boat and back to reality. I cannot say enough about how amazing the staff was to us!

I will also be trying to list out what we did daily in chronological order.

* **Travel In -** We had a driver take us from our house to the LAX airport, this is key to making sure you don't have a ton of stress trying to find parking or being charged a bunch while using the airport parking. We arrived at the International Terminal and joined the mass of people flying out on a Friday night. Fiji Airways made it fairly simple to check-in and and get through the security.
* **Day 1 -** Relaxing as we arrived very early in the morning.
* **Day 2 -** Lover's cove.
* **Day 3 -** Relax day
* **Day 4 -** Nadi Village Visit, Erica massage
* **Day 5 -** Relax in the morning
* **Travel Out -** Small airport, long travel, car from airport getting home around 3pm to pick up daughter
